Depends on ConfigMachine! That can be found here: https://www.raindb.net/ in Tools

## New mod behavior
+ When bit by a lizard, instead of randomly killing the player, the player takes damage.
+ Too much damage equals death.
+ Some time after being released, or after the start of a cycle, damage is reset.

## Unchanged vanilla behavior
+ When not killed by a bite, slugcat is only grabbed, so you can still escape with your life if your captor drops you before reaching a den.
+ The creature will drop you if it is stunned.
+ After a moment, it will paralyze slugcat, so hit it with a rock or spear quickly!
