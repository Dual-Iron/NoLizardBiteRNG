Can be configured using ConfigMachine, found [here](https://www.raindb.net/).

This is a BepInEx mod; it will not work with Partiality. If you're not using BepInEx, you should be.

Available on the [Realm](https://github.com/Dual-Iron/RwModLoader) browser!

## New mod behavior
+ Lizard bites deal damage instead of randomly killing you.
+ If you take too much damage, you die.
+ Some time after being released, or after the cycle ends, damage is reset.\*
+ Lizards kill just as often. For example: In vanilla, a pink lizard kills in 3 bites _on average_; with this mod, a pink lizard kills in 3 bites _always_.\*

\* this behavior is configurable

## Unchanged vanilla behavior
+ When not killed by a bite, slugcat is only grabbed, so you can still escape with your life if your captor drops you before reaching a den.
+ The creature will drop you if it is stunned.
+ After a moment, it will paralyze slugcat, so hit it with a rock or spear quickly!
